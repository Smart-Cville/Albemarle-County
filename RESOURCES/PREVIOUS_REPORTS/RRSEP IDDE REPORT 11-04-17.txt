Rainwater and dirt have been flooding and backing up in the street. Because 
children play in the street they leave toys, balls, trash etc. around and do 
not pick it up.  The culprit is a basketball hoop erected by tenants occupying 
the property owned by a landlord at 286 Albert Court.  It draws children along 
with teenagers and some adults from other neighborhoods who drop trash, large 
articles and discarded materials into the storm drain.  While we recognize 
children need someplace to play, it has now become a nuisance and is denying 
residents of the quiet enjoyment of their property.
