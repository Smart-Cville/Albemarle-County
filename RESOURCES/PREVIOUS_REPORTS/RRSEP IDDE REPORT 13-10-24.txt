This was reported as an regular practice by ACAC.  I am president of the Four Seasons Townhouse 
Association, and at our annual meeting, several of the homeowners who live on the edge of the pond 
reported this.  They said that twice a year the pool is allowed to drain into the pond.  They said that the 
ACAC staff told them that they stop chlorinating the water first, but the homeowners were still 
concerned that this is having an adverse affect.
