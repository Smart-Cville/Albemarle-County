3. TYPE-OF-IDDE = Water in Stream is an Unusual Color
4. COMMENTS = about 2 weeks ago the water was an incredibly dark and thick muddy brown. I have lived along the river for 4 years and never seen it like this. It was truely alarming.  I later noticed a large piece of land that has been clear cut above the river along Red Hill Road (near where it intersects Rt. 29 South). I think this could be the reason and it made me think that the developer must have some obligation to protect the river from the effects of this construction.  My neighbor came over to inquire about it as well.  She was really concerned and didn't know what to do about it.
