4. COMMENTS = I am a Civil Engineer in the Current Development Department of Albemarle County.  I am currently reviewing the ESC/SWM plans for the Charlottesville/Albemarle Airport Runway extension which is located about 2000ft upstream of Chris Greene Lake in Northern Albemarle County.  Earlier today I met with a concerned downstream property owner who mentioned that in the upper reaches of the lake there is a large amount of rubber debris (from the tires of planes landing presumably) that seems to have come from the airport.  Unfortunately, this isn't my area of expertise and I do not know if this qualifies as illicit discharge.  For this SWM plan we are reviewing, we will request that they address our concern about the rubber particles, but only 10%-20% of the runway drains into these new facilities.


To clarify, I have not seen the area in question or noticed any rubber particles, but the citizen I met with earlier today mentioned it and I thought I would pass it along.  The gentleman's name is Allan Kindrick and he can be reached at 434-973-5436.


If I can be of any assistance, please feel free to call or email me.


Thanks,
Phil
