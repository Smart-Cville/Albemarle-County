1. DATE = July 12, 2009
2. TIME = 9:35 a.m. onward
3. TYPE-OF-IDDE = Dumping Down a Storm Drain
4. LOCATION-OF-IDDE COMMENTS = Pressure washing restaurant equipment and floor mats behind Otto's restaurant. Also, the grease cans next to the dumpster behind the restaurant are a source of grease pollution into the storm drains, which are just a few feet away. I'm unsure if this activity meets the threshold for action, but it certainly is a non-point source of pollution, if only a relatively small amount. None of the other restaurants that share this building pressure wash their equipment out back. I wish to remain anonymous.
